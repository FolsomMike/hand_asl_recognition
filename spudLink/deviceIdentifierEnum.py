# Function:
#
# Defines identifier codes for each device on the different networks.
#
# Some devices are the only device on a given network, so they are easily identified by their ethernet, I2C, or com port
# addresses. Others may share a single serial port and this identifier is used as an address in such case.
#
# All packet headers contain the destination device's identifier and the source device's identifier.
